Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 150s. when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived only five centuries,but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</br> It was popularised in the 1920s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Loren Ipsum passage, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Loren Ipsum.
